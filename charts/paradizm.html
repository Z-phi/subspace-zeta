        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class = "no-indent"><p2>This chart is a fantastic example of how basic and advanced applications of well-structured motifs can offer an enriching experience with a very high-energy song. One of the main motifs in this chart was the idea of consistent pitch relevance and advanced layering techniques to create a seamless and immersive experience to the player, while also adhering to the song's many nuances.</p2></div>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <div class = "no-indent"><p2>As mentioned previously, this song is very high-energy - the idea was for the chart to match that intensity. By using a mix of quick bursts, mine pull-offs, minijacks, and strong chords, the intensity of the song was matched and keeps the player energized throughout play.</p2></div>
        <div class = "no-indent"><p2>I realized quickly that there were going to be some technically accurate sacrifices I had to make in order to keep the chart playing how I intended it to. For instance, minijacks are placed at times where the piano is obviously ascending in pitch. The use of minijacks here brought out a much more intense feeling to the player allowing for a much more satisfying crash into the next note. </p2></div>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <div class = "no-indent"><p2><strong>Key Point 1 </strong>[22.826]: In this section I've highlighted, this acts as a bridge, or transition, between the main chorus as it ascends to a higher key. The use of a minijack on 2 from [23] into [124] holds not only brings out the very prominent crash, but also the intensity of the chord being played. As the [124] is being held down, you quickly release the holds to hit [124] one more time, but while being less impactful, it's a much different transition than the minijack that formed from the [23]. This swift release into a slam makes this feel even more dramatic, as following directly after are two mines to apply pressure and encapsulate the pull-off feeling that otherwise would not have felt as dramatic. Following, is the same concept, but instead applied to [24] into a [134]. There are no holds this time, strictly because there is no held piano sound that follows after the initial [134]. This is a strong point to analyze as this is one motif that is played several times throughout the chart.</p2></div>
        <div class = "no-indent"><p2><strong>Key Point 2 </strong>[59.454]: In this next section I've highlighted, it acts as one of the most prominent and strongest points in the chart. This strong chord ascension is uncompletely unexpected during sightread and has a good chance of tripping the player up with the odd rhythms that are at play. </p2></div>
